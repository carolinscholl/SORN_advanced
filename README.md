# Self-Organizing-Recurrent-Network-Simulator
The "Self Organizing Recurrent Network Simulator" allows you to create different Neuron-Groups, define their Behaviour and connect them with Synapse-Groups.

With this you can create all kinds of biological plausible networks, which, for example, mimic the learning mechanisms of cortical structures.

The user interface allows you to display your network in an interactive way and to add new visualization modules.
